# Reflection by Favour Ojo

My idea would be to using separate methods to make the processes more simple. With all the
types of codes needed for this program, the code runs out very long and different could be use to simplify the code. My peer Kyrie had a similar idea like this. She suggested we should use more switch statements instead of using the if, if else, else if statements for this program. I agree because, like I said earlier, the code should be less complicated and not be a very long code. Our other peer Kai'lani suggested a interesting suggesting on using decimal format near the end so our output would only exceed to 2 decimal places.
